# Summary

## Relu

I have approximated ReLU using Chebyshev polynomials. Tried with both with degree 3 and 4 polynomials. Degree 3 is faster computation time, however, degree 4 provides better accuracy.

## Concrete dataset

Began work on a second dataset, the Concrete Compressive Strength Data set. Aim is to predict the compressive strength of concrete given 8 real valued attributes. Using degree 4 relu approximation I achieve a RMSE or 75 on the encrypted data compared to 50 on the unencrypted data. 

## Problems

* When using a degree 4 approximation it is more likely that a multiplication in the final layer of the network will 'overflow', causing extrememly large or small values. I experienced this problem on just one data point when I first ran the concrete experiments. This multiplication resulted in the largest value overall and just 'overflowed' the encryption parameters. To solve this I used L2 regularization in the network to keep the weight values as small as possible. However, I believe with data that has larger output values this will be an issue. Some solutions:
    * Increase encryption parameteres. This would result in more headroom so to speak but would increase the runtime significantly.
    * Scale the output to have zero mean and unit variance. Train the network on this data and then rescale the predictions to their original mean and variance. Has the advantage of not increasing runtime.

* Found a bug in the batch normalization code. I believe the Keras function 'get_weights' that returns the weights and parameters for all layers in the model is incorrect. The documentation led me to believe that one of the values returned was the standard deviation of the batch, however, I now believe this is actually the variance. This led to errors as I was squaring the value returned to me in my batch normalization code, believing it was the standard deviation, to obtain the variance.

## Next steps

* More data sets. Try some classification tasks as well as regression tasks. 
* Run speed and accuracy comparisons
