# Summary

## Sigmoid

Implemented sigmoid function using Maclaurin approximation to 3 terms.

## Batch normalization

It appears that using the shift and scale causes values to exit range that sigmoid would work well in. Could use a batch normalization layer that doesn't use shifting and scaling, however, a better approximation for an activation function would likely be more useful.
