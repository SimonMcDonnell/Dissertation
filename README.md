# Privacy Preserving Deep Learning
This project will analyse the practicality of using Deep Learning in conjunction with Homomorphic Encryption. I will be using Microsoft's SEAL library for encrypting the data before passing it through different Neural Network architectures with various different activation functions. The performance of using SEAL will then be assessed.
